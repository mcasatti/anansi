This paper defines a formalism, called conceptual graphs, that can describe data according to the user's view and access data according to the system's view. In addition, the graphs can represent functional dependencies in the data base and support inferences and computations that are not explicit in the initial query.},

With this practical book, you’ll learn how to design and implement a graph database that brings the power of graphs to bear on a broad range of problem domains. Whether you want to speed up your response to user queries or build a database that can adapt as your business evolves, this book shows you how to apply the schema-free graph model to real-world problems.This second edition includes new code samples and diagrams, using the latest Neo4j syntax, as well as information on new functionality. Learn how different organizations are using graph databases to outperform their competitors. With this book’s data modeling, query, and code examples, you’ll quickly be able to implement your own solution.Model data with the Cypher query language and property graph {modelLearn} best practices and common pitfalls when modeling with {graphsPlan} and implement a graph database solution in test-driven {fashionExplore} real-world examples to learn how and why organizations use a graph {databaseUnderstand} common patterns and components of graph database {architectureUse} analytical techniques and algorithms to mine graph database information},
